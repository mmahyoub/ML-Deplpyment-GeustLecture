# Machine Learning Deployment - Guest Lecture 
In this repository, you will find the Jupyter Notebook for codes explained in a guest lecture at University of Alabama at Birmingham at  on 3/20/2023. The Jupyter Notebook was used as a lab for:
- Accessing and processing data.
- Creating and running training script.
- Creating and running deployment script.
- Writing Dockerfiles and creating docker images.
- Accessing Micrsofot Azure to build/register containers and create a web app.

Note: Jupyter Notebook was not used to create the deployment codes (not recommended); it was used as a lab for developing modeling and deployment artificats. 

In this lecture, we covered offline deployment mode (single entry and batch):
  - Deploy model using Flask wrapped with Swagger on premise.
  - Containerize ML webapp using docker container on premise. 
  - Cotainerize and deploy model on the cloud (Microsoft Azure). 

Predownloads and requirements in addition to Jupyter Notebook:
- Docker https://www.docker.com/
- If you are interested to practice the cloud deployment part.
  - Azure subscription https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/get-started/azure-portal
  - Azure CLI  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli
